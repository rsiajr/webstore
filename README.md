## Message to Rocco:

Hi Rocco, for some reason the actual github site using the github link doesn't show the background image and gifs (I already changed the files from .webp to .gif). If the body background (stone type) and the Tim's ad and Weather gifs do not work, please clone the repository. Apologies for the additional steps but I couldn't determine the appropriate fix (I thought the file update from .webp to gif would do it - I redownloaded the gifs for this).
